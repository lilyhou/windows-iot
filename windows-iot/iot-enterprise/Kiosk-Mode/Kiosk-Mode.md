# Kiosk Mode  
Windows 10 IoT Enterprise allows you to build fixed purpose devices such as ATM machines, point-of-sale terminals, medical devices, digital signs or kiosks. Kiosk mode helps you create a dedicated and locked down user experience on these fixed purpose devices. Windows 10 offers a set of different locked-down experiences for public or specialized use: assigned access single-app kiosks, assigned access multi-app kiosks or shell launcher.

Kiosk configurations are based upon either [assigned access](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/guidelines-for-assigned-access-app) or [shell launcher](./Shell-Launcher.md). There are several kiosk configuration methods that you can choose from, depending on your answers to the following questions.

## Which type of app will your kiosk run?
Your kiosk can run a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app or a Windows desktop application. For [digital signage](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/setup-digital-signage), simply select a digital sign player as your kiosk app. Check out the [guidelines for kiosk apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/guidelines-for-assigned-access-app).

## Which type of kiosk do you need?
If you want your kiosk to run a single app for anyone to see or use, consider a single-app kiosk that runs either a [Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/kiosk-methods#uwp) or a [Windows desktop application](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/kiosk-methods#classic). For a kiosk that people can sign in to with their accounts or that runs more than one app, consider a [multi-app kiosk](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/kiosk-methods#desktop).

## Which type of user account will be the kiosk account?
The kiosk account can be a local standard user account, a domain account, or an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account, depending on the method that you use to configure the kiosk. If you want people to sign in and authenticate on the device, you should use a assigned access multi-app kiosk configuration. The single-app kiosk configuration doesn't require people to sign in to the device, although they can sign in to the kiosk app if you select an app that has a sign-in method.
