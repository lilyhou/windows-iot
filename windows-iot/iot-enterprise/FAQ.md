# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
This document outlines the Frequently Asked Questions by our customers and partners.

*If you require additional assistance, please [Contact Us](./Contact-Us.md).*

## What Windows IoT Solutions are available today?
There are presently three versions of Windows IoT available: [Windows 10 IoT Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/iot-core/windows-iot-enterprise),[Windows 10 IoT Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/iot-core/windows-iot-core),  and [Windows Server IoT 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/iot-core/windows-server).

## What is the difference between Windows 10 IoT Enterprise and IoT Core?
IoT Enterprise is binary-equivalent to standard Windows Enterprise. We have incorporated all IoT features into both versions, but the IoT edition includes a few minor config differences at activation and has dramatically different pricing and licensing terms. Windows 10 IoT Core is the smallest version of the Windows 10 editions that leverages the Windows 10 common core architecture. These editions enable building low-cost devices with fewer resources. Development for Windows 10 IoT Core leverages the Universal Windows Platform.

## How do I know if I am running Windows 10 IoT Enterprise?
Prior to version 1903, Windows 10 IoT Enterprise was sold as Windows 10 Enterprise with special keys.
However, version 1903 and onward, Windows 10 IoT Enterprise is sold as a separate edition.

Windows 10 IoT Enterprise Version 1903 and beyond, you will be able to confirm you are running Windows 10 IoT Enterprise under System Information.

## How do people typically manage their IoT Solutions?
Listed below are the four most-commonly used management methods for IoT solutions.

### Traditional
Microsoft [System Center Configuration (SCCM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/system-center/), a solution typically used by IT departments, works with IoT Enterprise under current support terms. There is an exception process if your customer requires SCCM on IoT Core – please contact us with that request.

### Mobile Device Management (MDM)
You can use [Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) (and other Non-Microsoft MDMs like: VMWare AirWatch, MobileIron, etc.) with both IoT Enterprise and IoT Core, again this is a solution typically administered by IT departments.

### Azure IoT
You can also build your own device management using [Azure IoT Device Twin and the Azure Device Agent](https://github.com/ms-iot/azure-client-tools/blob/master/docs/device-agent/device-agent.md) for IoT Core/IoT Enterprise. This method is mostly used by IoT Solution Operators.

### Device Update Center
[Device Update Center (DUC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/service/iot/using-device-update-center) is available for IoT Core today. DUC is not really device management, but it is included in this list for completeness. DUC is update control which is staged before device management in the control chain. This means that you (or your customers) can still use device management if you choose DUC for upstream control. This service is often used in conjunction with Azure Device Agent by appliance device builders.
